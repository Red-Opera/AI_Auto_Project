Development Goal: Create an AI simulation system that automatically solves Sokoban puzzle games with Pygame visualization.

Key Requirements:
1) Parse map data from the provided 'sokoban-maps-60-plain.txt' file to generate game maps.
2) Automatically solve all maps sequentially from map 1 to map 60.
3) Implement Sokoban game rules perfectly:
   - The player (@) can move up, down, left, and right.
   - The player can push boxes (*) but cannot pull them.
   - Boxes can only be pushed one at a time (cannot push multiple boxes simultaneously).
   - Boxes cannot pass through walls (X) or other boxes.
   - A level is completed when all boxes are placed on target points (.).
   - A box on a target point is represented by a special character ($).
   - A player on a target point is represented by a special character (+).

4) Implement AI solving algorithms autonomously. Choose and implement the most effective approach:
   - BFS (Breadth-First Search)
   - DFS (Depth-First Search)
   - A* algorithm
   - Heuristic-based search
   - Deadlock detection and handling mechanisms
   - Pattern databases or precomputed heuristics

5) Visualization using Pygame:
   - Create a graphical interface using Pygame to display the game board.
   - Show the player, boxes, walls, and target points with appropriate sprites or colors.
   - Animate each movement step with smooth transitions.
   - Display the solution progress, current map number, and total moves.
   - Add a visual indication when a map is solved.
   - The visualization should be clean and user-friendly.

6) Automatic execution mode:
   - When executed with the command-line argument '--auto-solve', all maps should be solved automatically without user input.
   - Output "MAP_X_COMPLETE" message when each map is solved (X is the map number).
   - Output "ALL_MAPS_COMPLETE_SUCCESS" message when all maps are solved.
   - Display appropriate error messages for unsolvable maps.

7) Performance and optimization:
   - Find the optimal solution (minimum number of moves) for each map.
   - Explore the state space in a memory-efficient manner.
   - Implement mechanisms to prevent infinite loops or deadlocks.

8) Exception handling and error management:
   - Handle map parsing errors appropriately.
   - Handle memory limitations and timeouts.
   - Detect and report unsolvable maps appropriately.

9) Statistics and analysis:
   - Record solving time, number of moves, and number of states explored for each map.
   - Provide summary statistics for all maps.

Technical Implementation Requirements:
- The program must be implemented in Python.
- Use Pygame for visualization and standard libraries for core functionality.
- The AI should autonomously determine the best implementation approach.
- Code should be modular and object-oriented.
- Provide appropriate comments and documentation.
- Include test cases.
- Ensure there are no compilation or runtime errors.

This system must be capable of automatically solving all 60 provided Sokoban maps, featuring efficient algorithms and an engaging visualization through Pygame.
